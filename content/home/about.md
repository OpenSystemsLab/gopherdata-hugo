GopherData brings together "gophers" (or Go programmers) who use and develop data analysis tools. The organization does this by providing online resources and in-person events. The goals are to provide data analysis enthusiasts, across various domains, with outlets to discuss how best to apply Go and tools built with Go to analytics, scientific research, database development, machine learning, visualization, etc.

We aim to be community-driven and accessible to novice Go programmers, experienced Gophers, data scientists without Go experience, data engineers, and anyone else who is interested in Go for data analysis. On this site you will find related blog posts, a listing of events, and links to a variety of online forums for discussion and learning.
